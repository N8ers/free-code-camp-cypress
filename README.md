# fcc-cypress

Congratulations, you've found the companion repository to a [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) talk on the end-to-end testing tool [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)!

This app is written in vue.js, but please don't look at it too closely! Some best practices were ignored for the sake of education.

## Overview of Branches

This project has several branches, feel free to use the one that best meets your needs.

1. `1-start-here` - If you want to install and initialize cypress on your own, start here.
1. `2-test-your-might` - Cypress is initialized and configured, several test files have been made with test prompts that you can then write tests for. This branch is an oppertunity to TEST YOUR MIGHT ðŸ’ª.
1. `3-the-answers-to-everything` - Answers to the prompts that were provided in branch `2-test-your-might`.

## Project Setup

**NOTE:** You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed for this project to work locally.

1. clone the project

```sh
git clone git@github.com:N8ers/free-code-camp-cypress.git
```

2. check out the branch of your choice (the snippet below checks out the branch `3-test-your-might`)

```sh
git checkout 3-test-your-might
```

3. install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

4. run the project locally

```sh
npm run dev
```

If you've checked out a branch other than `1-start-here`, then cypress will be a part of your dependencies. The cypress GUI can be launched with `npx cypress open`.

**NOTE:** `npx cypress open` **REQUIRES** the project server to be running (step 4 above).
